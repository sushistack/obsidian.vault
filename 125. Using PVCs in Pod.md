Once you create a PVC use it in a POD definition file by specifying the PVC Claim name under persistentVolumeClaim section in the volumes section like this:


```yml
1. apiVersion: v1
2. kind: Pod
3. metadata:
4. name: mypod
5. spec:
6. containers:
7. - name: myfrontend
8. image: nginx
9. volumeMounts:
10. - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
11. name: mypd
12. volumes:
13. - name: mypd
14. persistentVolumeClaim:
15. claimName: myclaim
```


The same is true for ReplicaSets or Deployments. Add this to the pod template section of a Deployment on ReplicaSet.

Q2. What volume type is to be used to mount a directory from the node on which the pod is running?
A2. hostPath


Q3. What volume type is used to store data in a Pod only as long as that Pod is running on that node? When the Pod is deleted the files are to be deleted as well.
A3. emptyDir


Q4. What is the `fc` volume type used for?

To mount an existing Fibre channel volume into a Pod

### Practice

```sh
$ kubectl exec webapp -- cat /log/app.log
```

```
Volumes:
  kube-api-access-vr7fb:
    Type:                    Projected (a volume that contains injected data from multiple sources)
```

위와 같기 때문에 컨테이너가 종료되면 볼륨은 날아간다.


```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: event-simulator
    image: kodekloud/event-simulator
    env:
    - name: LOG_HANDLERS
      value: file
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /log
      name: log-volume

  volumes:
  - name: log-volume
    hostPath:
      # directory location on host
      path: /var/log/webapp
      # this field is optional
      type: Directory
```
