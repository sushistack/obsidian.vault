### Spring MVC Limitations

- Thread pool size of Embedded tomcat in Spring MVC’s is **200**
- Can we increase the thread pool size based on the need ?
	- Yes, only to a certain limit.
- Let’s say you have a use case to support **10000** concurrent users.
	- Can we create a thread pool of size **10000** Threads ?
		- No

### **Thread and its Limitations**

- Thread is an expensive resource
- It can easily take up to 1MB of heap space
- More threads means more memory consumption by the thread itself
- Less heap space for actually processing the request

### **Callbacks**

- Asynchronous methods that accept a callback as a parameter and invokes it  when the blocking call completes.
- Writing code with Callbacks are hard to compose and difficult to read and maintain
- **Callbackhell**

## What is Reactive Programming ?

- Reactive Programming is a new programming paradigm
- Asynchronous and non blocking
- Data flows as an **Event/Message** driven stream
